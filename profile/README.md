## Welcome to the Public Github for the EMPIRIC Project 👋

EMPIRIC is a group with a shared goal of improving climate model data accessibility for small islands, particulary Pacific Island States. 

We have produced a number of products which enable enhanced understanding of climate extremes. These include:

  The Optimal Path Threshold Method (Zhao, Horvat, and Gao, 2025). A methodology for rigorously identifying extreme events.
